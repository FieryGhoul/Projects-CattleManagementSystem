# Cattle Management System

## Overview

The Cattle Management System (CMS) is a comprehensive application built with Java and JavaFX that enables farmers to register cattle, apply for insurance policies, and file claims in case of cattle loss or illness. The system places a strong emphasis on data integrity and security by implementing checksums and audit logging to prevent unauthorized modifications to critical data.

## Key Features

### User Authentication & Authorization
- Secure login system with password hashing
- Role-based access control (Farmers and Administrators)
- Protection against unauthorized access

### Cattle Registration and Management
- Easy-to-use interface for registering new cattle
- Unique identification number (UID) assigned to each cattle
- Store comprehensive details including breed, age, weight, and vaccination records
- Data integrity validation using SHA-256 checksums

### Insurance Policy Management
- View available insurance policies for cattle
- Dynamic premium calculation based on risk factors
- Premium factors consider cattle breed, age, and health history
- Policy status tracking and management

### Insurance Claim Processing
- Streamlined claim submission process with documentation upload
- Claim tracking system for farmers
- Admin dashboard for claim review and approval
- Data integrity verification during claim processing
- Automated payout processing after approval

### Audit Logging and Security
- Comprehensive audit trail of all system actions
- Checksum validation to detect unauthorized data modifications
- Secure storage of sensitive information
- Transaction integrity protection

## System Architecture

### Database Schema
The system uses the following database tables:
- `users`: Stores farmer and admin account information
- `cattle`: Manages cattle registration data
- `insurance_policies`: Contains available insurance policies
- `insurance_claims`: Tracks claim submissions and statuses
- `audit_log`: Records all system actions for accountability

### Core Components
1. **Authentication Service**: Handles user login and session management
2. **Cattle Management Module**: Provides CRUD operations for cattle records
3. **Insurance Service**: Calculates premiums and manages policies
4. **Claims Processing Engine**: Facilitates claim submission and review
5. **Audit System**: Records system activities with checksums

## Security Features

### Data Integrity
- SHA-256 checksums for all critical records
- Validation checks before any data modification
- Detection of unauthorized changes

### Secure Authentication
- Password hashing with salt
- Session management
- Role-based access control

### Audit Logging
- Immutable logs of all system actions
- Checksum protection for audit trails
- Comprehensive activity monitoring

## Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java 17+
- **UI Framework**: JavaFX
- **Database**: SQL (compatible with MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- **Security**: SHA-256 for checksums and password hashing
- **Build Tool**: Maven/Gradle

### Design Patterns
- **Singleton Pattern**: For database connection management
- **MVC Pattern**: Separation of model, view, and controller
- **Observer Pattern**: For UI updates
- **Factory Pattern**: For creating different types of insurance policies

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
- MySQL/PostgreSQL database
- Maven or Gradle for dependency management

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cattle-management-system.git
   ```

2. Configure database connection in `database.properties`:
   ```
   db.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/cms_db
   db.user=your_username
   db.password=your_password
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```
   java -jar target/cms-1.0.jar
   ```

## Usage Guide

### For Farmers

   - Create a new account with personal and farm details
   - Login with credentials

2. **Cattle Management**
   - Register new cattle with required details
   - View and update existing cattle information
   - Transfer cattle ownership when needed

3. **Insurance Management**
   - Browse available policies
   - Calculate and pay premiums
   - Track policy status

4. **Claim Submission**
   - Submit claims with required documentation
   - Track claim status
   - Receive notifications on claim updates

### For Administrators
1. **User Management**
   - View registered farmers
   - Manage user access

2. **Policy Administration**
   - Create and manage insurance policies
   - Adjust premium calculation parameters

3. **Claim Processing**
   - Review submitted claims
   - Verify documentation and cattle details
   - Approve or reject claims with reasoning
   - Monitor payout processing

4. **System Monitoring**
   - View audit logs
   - Check system integrity
   - Generate reports

## Development and Extension

### Adding New Features
The system is designed to be modular, allowing for easy extension:
1. Create new model classes in the appropriate package
2. Implement corresponding service classes
3. Add UI components using JavaFX
4. Update database schema as needed

## Data Integrity Model
The system ensures data integrity through:
1. **Generation**: Create checksum upon record creation
2. **Storage**: Store checksum with record
3. **Validation**: Verify checksum before any operation
4. **Regeneration**: Create new checksum after modifications
5. **Audit**: Log all changes with checksums
